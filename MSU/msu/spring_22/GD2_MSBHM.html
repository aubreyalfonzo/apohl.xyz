				<p>ABOUT:<br><br>This project was conducted on 
behalf of the Graphic Design program at the Mississippi State University College of Art, Architecture, and Design under instruction of Visiting Assistant Professor Aubrey Pohl.<br><br>For this project, students were asked to select a figure from a preselected list of African American activists, martyrs, artists, musicians, and beyond. Students were not confined to the list, nor was every figure tied directly to the state of Mississippi.<br><br>
The goal was to not only to react visually to the important Black History of Mississippi and its influences on America and the world, but to engage the program in an examination and appreciation for this history.<br><br>
The posters are available for purchase, and all profits will be split between the Black Prairie Blues Museum, and the Mississippi Humanities Council. If you are interested in purchasing a poster, please reach out to Aubrey Pohl at

				<p>THANKS:<br><br>A special thanks to all who came before us, who have helped to pave the way for a new Mississippi, one that is inclusive to every human being regardless of race or creed.<br><br>It is important that we reflect on this history not selectively, but always, to understand that Mississippi’s Black History is Mississippi’s History, that our strength can be found in our diversity, and most crucially that we have a long way to go. Our efforts today matter tomorrow.</p>

					<strong>Margaret Walker</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Margaret Walker, a poet and novelist, was born on July 7,
1915, in Birmingham, Alabama. With her first poem being published
in 1934, this marked the start of her writing career.
In 1936, she became a part of the Federal Writers’ Project and
the South Side Writers Group where she participated in the
movement called The Chicago Black Renaissance. One of her most
reputable pieces, Jubilee, is regarded as “the first truly
historical black American novel.” Walker’s work was well-received
because of the realism of her work and how she was able
to accurately represent the black experience and culture of
her time. Margaret Walker passed away on November 30, 1998, in
Chicago.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					Since she wrote poetry, I wanted to base my poster on this
concept. I knew I wanted to include a quote by Walker, or any
quote from her writings, and manipulate it into a beautiful
form and stanza layout. The overall goal was to create a very
simplistic and elegant layout, which relates back to the way
that poetry is typically perceived. I found the image of her
(shown in poster) and knew immediately that I wanted to use it
because of how happy she looked. Though the areas of her face
were placed randomly, seeing it now, her senses become showcased.
She sees, she hears, then she speaks — mainly through
her writing.
I wanted the colors to compliment this idea of simplicity,
so I went with a muted yellow and purple. Additional shapes
and textures were then overlayed to create a few pops of bold
color which helped add more contrast to the design. I really
wanted the poster to feel like it was a piece of paper taken
out of a book.
The featured quote is from her poem “For My People.” The bottom
shapes begin to take on the shape of a flower, and the
placement of “let a people loving freedom come to growth” just
seemed to naturally belong there.

					<strong>B.B. KING</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					B.B. King, born Riley B. King, was born in Berlcair,
Mississippi on Septemeber 16th, 1925. He became known performing
on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, where he got the
nickname “Beale Street Blues Boy”, later shortened to “Blues
Boy” or B.B. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential
blues artists of all time, even earning the title of
“The King of Blues”. He is a 1987 inductee into the Rock and
Roll hall of fame, a Presidential Medal of Freedom receipient,
and number 3 on Time magazine’s Top-10 electric guitarists of
all time, just to name a few accolades. He died in Las Vegas,
Nevada in 2015.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					The idea came from King’s close connection to his guitar and
the idea of it being an extension of himself. The design went
through multiple iteratins before landing on the final one,
but simplifying the idea and the relationship of King and his
guitar and thus his music became the focal point of my work.
King is an extremely influential artist in the history of
Memphis, Tennessee, where I’m from, and it was very exciting
for me to able to work on something for him because of that
connection we share.

					<strong>SAM COOKE</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Sam Cooke was born in Clarksdale, MS in 1931. 
His death - while officially reported as a case of justified hoimcide commited by Bertha Franklin - has always been shrowded in mystery.
Sam Cooke grew up in the church, and when he began making music he started with gospel. Over the years he transisitioned into making more secular music. 
His music began to take a turn in favor of the civil rights movement, with “A Change is Gonna Come” becoming one of the anthems of the movement. 
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					In researching Sam Cooke, the very first thing I noticed about him was his joyful smile. I wanted to capture that in a simple way, while still exemplifying his role in the the civil rights movement. I did this by including the colors and lines of the African American flag subtly while keeping his smile and name at the forefront.

					<strong>FANNIE LOU HAMER</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					In Montgomery County, Mississippi, Fannie Hamer was born on October 26, 1917.  She passed on March 14, 1977 from breast cancer.  She was known for co-founding the freedom democratic party and many notable orations, the most famous being at Williams Institutional Chuch title “Sick and Tired of Being Sick and Tired”.  She was not only concerned about the rights of minorities, but also their economic power.  In order to aid this disparity, she launched the Freedom Farm Cooperative that allowed for black farmers to come together and farm collectively.  She was also able to purchase land and ensure that 200 affordable housing units were built and many still stand today in Ruleville.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					While doing research, I discovered that she was barred from the Mississippi House of Representatives ballot in 1964.  I decided to scan in majority of my poster and manually layer type because it was more authentic and true to the nature of  Fannie.  I also think scanning in documents like the ballot allows for a document to be seen that would otherwise be forgotten to us.  I think the most important design philosophy behind my work is to look at objects for what they are as well as what they  could be tranformed into.

					<strong>Medgar Wiley Evers</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Evers was born on July 2, 1925 in Decatur, Mississippi, and
his work began when, after being barred from voting upon his
return from fighting in World War II, he got involved with
the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, or RCNL, organizing 
boycotts and distributing promotional material. His work
promoting desegregation and his contributions to the Emmett
Till and Clyde Kennard cases led to his becoming a highprofile
target for white supremacists. In 1963, Evers was shot
just outside of his home in Jackson, MS at the age of 37, and
his murderer was not convicted until February of 1994. In the
time since his death, Evers’ legacy has become one of eventual
justice and long overdue acknowledgement and appreciation of
his work. Today, Evers’ story has inspired numerous pieces of
media and he is remembered through the Jackson Medgar Wiley
Evers International Airport, the Medgar Evers Institute, and
many other memorials, scholarships, and landmarks.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					My final design was inspired by the idea that both Evers’
fight for justice and the injustice he faced are at the
foundation of the progress being made today. The visuals
were developed through experimentation with overlaying an
image of the house in Jackson where Evers was assassinated
and an image of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. The
typography includes his quote, “Freedom has never been free”
and a variety of dates which I hope might inspire viewers to
pursue further research about his life and work. The events
referenced include: Evers’ birth (07.02.1925), his death
(06.12.1963), his marriage (12.42.1951), the date he was
named as the NAACP’s first field secretary for Mississippi
(11.24.1954), the day his murderer was arrested (06.21.1963),
and the day his murderer was finally convicted (02.05.1994).

					<strong>(Son House) Edward James House Jr.</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Son House was born in Lyon, Mississippi in March of 1902 and passed on October 19, 1988. He was known best for preaching and spreading the gospel during the day and playing at blues clubs by night.

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					I worked in a style I haven’t tried before, collaging, and I learned a lot through the process. Finding textures that work together when layered that don’t overwhelm the poster was difficult. It’s especially hard to layer things for such a lively person when you re trying to create a poster that isn’t too overwhelming to the eye because of the style, but still draws the eye in and around.

					<strong>Sister Rosetta Tharpe, “The Original Soul Sister”, “The Godmother
of Rock n’ Roll”</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Sister Rosetta Tharpe was born in Arkansas on March 20, 1915.
While women playing the electric guitar was almost unheard of
in her day, she created her own distinct style of using electric
guitar and RnB influences to create something the modern
world would later define as Rock ‘n Roll. This innovation in
music was even more impactful as Rosetta danced across the
lines of secular and gospel music regularly. She was actively
providing music for the religious and secular groups, the
white and black communities, and the straight and gay communities.
A large audience fell under the scope of her influence in a way that had never been seen before, and her Rock n Roll
style was the inspiration for many to come after her. Her life
was an eventful one, and on October 9, 1973 she passed away in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					I was heavily influenced by Reid Miles’ style for blues design.
Sister Rosetta Tharpe was a bold performer with an electric
sound who played for many different types of audiences.
I wanted to capture this boldness by using only graphic shapes
and text. I chose different shapes that I believed replicated
the distinct style of her sound, and I used bold reds and
blacks to be really eye catching. The overall goal was to allow
the viewer to experience her music and performance through
a simple, visual interpretation.

					<strong>Lizzie Douglas , better known as Memphis Minnie</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Memphis Minnie, known as the “Queen of the Country Blues,” was a singer, guitarist, and
songwriter. Her title stems from her legacy of successfully recording music across four
decades as well as being the lone female voice in a male dominated blues scene. She was
born in Tunica County, MS and died on August 6, 1973, at the age of 86. Her title “Queen
of the Country Blues” was no hype. Minnie did everything the boys could do, and she did
it in a fancy gown with full hair and makeup. She had it all: stellar guitar chops, a powerful
voice, a huge repertoire including many original, signature songs and a stage presence
simultaneously glamorous, bawdy and tough.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					For my poster I wanted to focus on the idea of her feminity yet also being very tough by
using a lot of contrast. I did a rough sketch of her that I then edited and then used a very
heavy bold font to contrast that. The font that I chose was designed by a black designer
who’s goal is to break the stero types in design. I added the crown because Memphis
Minnie is known as the “Queen of the Blues.”

					<strong>Lizzie Douglas (a.k.a. Memphis Minnie)</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Lizzie Douglas was born 3 June 1897 and died 6 August 1973.
Though she sings about being born in the Algiers neighborhood
of New Orleans, she was born in the Delta of Mississippi. She
came from a large family and ran away to Memphis when she was
8 and became the persona of Memphis Minnie. She had 3 husbands
and her career spanned over 30 years. She is known as the
“Queen of Blues” but she was part of the transitional period
of blues to the electrified Chicago sound. She lived the
last of her years in a nursing home and was buried in Walls,
Mississippi.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					One of Memphis Minnie’s famous songs was titled “Bumble
Bee.” Since she was known as the Queen of Blues, I decided
to combine these facts into the personality of a Queen Bee.
My poster design is inspired from a playing card (which also
reflects the risks she took as a young artist who often had to
gamble her career and survival as a woman). The alliteration
of her name allowed me to easily play with the reflective
design of a playing card. The bees are the card’s suit. I
included hexagons as well, not only to add to the connection
of the bees, but also because the shape itself has 6 sides;
the instrument she played the most (guitar) has 6 strings.

					<strong>Jimmy “Duck” Holmes</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Jimmy was born

a specific type of blues called the “Bentonia Blues.” Jimmy
is still the owner and operator of the blue front cafe. The
cafe has been honored with a prestigious blues trail marker
for such a historic blues history.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					The main tool that I
used for my design was illustrator, but I incorporated my own
type into the design. All of my analog type was brought into
Photoshop and edited to the final version of the design. The
overall use of abstract forms is probably my most important
design philosophy.

					<strong>Christone “Kingfish” Ingram</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Kingfish was born in Clarksdale, MS on January 19, 1999. He
became interested in blues around the age of 5 and has been

11 and started performing in his teen years. Kingfish has performed
with artists like Eric Gales, Buddy Guy, and Tedeschi

most recent being “662”, released in July 23, 2021.

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					The idea behind my design was to create something that appeared
“old” but new. I researched old blues and jazz ablums
that featured reduced forms and color palettes, and wanted to
have the subject of the poster be a callback to that.

					<strong>Mamie Smith</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Mamie Smith was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on May 26, 1891. She
started performing as a dancer when she was only 10 years old,
which was the start of her career. Around 1913, she moved
to New York City to pursue being a performer in Harlem. In
February 1920, she made history by being the first African
American vocalist to record a blues song, with her hits “That
Thing Called Love” and “You Can’t Keep a Good Man Down”. Later
in the year in AUgust, she recorded her most popular song
“Crazy Blues”, which in 1994 was inducted into the Grammy Hall
of Fame, and in 2005, it was selected to be preserved in the
Library of Congress. Around the 1940s, she made appearances
in some films. She passed away in 1946 in New York, where her
grave went unmarked for decates until a monument was made in
her honor in 2013.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					Mamie Smith seemed like a really classy lady, adored by many,
so I wanted to honor her with a minimal, nonrepresentational
style for the poster. I chose fonts that called back to the
1920s but still felt modern. There was a quote I read that
someone had described her as “a riot of whirling color,
twinkling feet, and jazz melodies”, and I really wanted to
integrate that quote into this project because that felt
personal to her, not just statistics about her life or when
her songs were produced.

					<strong>John Smith Hurt (Mississippi John Hurt)</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Mississippi John Hurt was born on March 8,1892 in Caroll County,
Mississippi. There is a dispute over exactly where he was
born, but the most likely spot is Avalon, near Greenwood. He
is very well known for his own guitar style, unencumbered by
popular influence. It may have been the part of isolation from
the modern blues world that allowed his music to continue to
remain pure Delta Blues sound.Unfortunately, it was also the
isolation that prevented the folklorists from finding him
again.They certainly tried, but no avail, simply assuming that
he had died.He was rediscoverd by Tom Hoskins in 1963 back
down in Carrol County,MS. After comeback, he seems to achieved
national recognization in a short time.He had only more three 
years of additional fame before he died.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					What was it that you discovered in your research that informed
your design choices? What styles, methods, and tools did you
work with and why? What is the most important design philosophy
behind your work?
Honestly, listening to his music was my first discovery of
this project.Additionally,his life story about his isolation
for 35 years during the time of depression was more interesting
to me.After some research, I came up with the idea of
representing him with graphic shapes and texture which seems
confusing and little amount of roughness.Listening and feeling
his music in my head, I drew the whole thing in illustrator
and a took little help from photoshop for my texture.

					<strong>Denise LaSalle</strong><br><br>

crown. I worked in Adobe Illustrator to create a crown out of
letters from Denise LaSalle’s name and names of her songs and 
albums. I worked in Illustrator because it was easier for me
to manipulate the type in the way that I wanted. I think the
most importatn design philosophy behind my work is the consideration
of type and the imagery of royalty that I wanted to be
consistant.

					<strong>Mamie Smith</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Mamie Smith was born on May 26, 1883 and passed away on September 16, 1946. She is
from Cincinnati Ohio and moved to Harlem in 1913, at age 20. She became most popular
from her record version of “Crazy Blues” in 1920. This song is considered to be the first
blues recording, as it proceeded to bring much attention the blues genre.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					The design concept behind my poster in particular was focusing in on being able to incorporate
each important part about Mamie. I used Procreate to create each piece of this
poster. In my initial reseach I planned on adding some blues, golds, and purples to make
the connection with old jazz music. Also, wanted to find for some big bold type that fits
her name and the composition well.

					<strong>Denise Lasalle</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Denise Lasalle was born in Leflore County, Mississippi on July
16, 1939. When she was young, she dreamed of being a writer.
She began singing with the Sacred Five,an all female gospel
group, when she was thirteen. In 1962 she signed with erh
first record company, Chess Records. Soon after she signed
with Westbounf Records and began putting out hit singles such
as “Trapped By A Thing Called Love”, “Now Run and Tell That”,
and “A Man Size Job”. In 1998 she received the 1998 Living
Blues Critic’s Award for her album “Smokin in Bed” and the
1998 Blues Artist of the Year. She founded the National Association
for the Preservation of the Blues in 1986 to give more
recognition to Southern Blues artists who were getting overlooked
in the mainstream media. Sadly, Denise Lasalle passed
away on January 8, 2018.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					One thing that stood out to me was Denise Lasalle’s fashion.
The bright colors and sparkling rhinestones compliment her
personality. I included the bright pink from her albums “Unwrapped”
and “I’m So Hot” to further accentuate her personality.
I wanted to combine her eye catching outfits with her
iconic music. To achieve this goal, I photographed a pattern
that I made with rhinestones on a bright pink piece of fabric.
I used the photograph to mask out the shape of Denise Lasalle’s
hairstyle from the “I’m So Hot” album cover.

					<strong>"Big Joe" Williams</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Big Joe Williams was born in Oktibeha County Mississippi
on October 16th 1903. He was a famous delta blues artist how
was well known for playing on his nine string guitar. He
travelled around the country and was known for working with
other blues artists such as Bessie Mae Smith and Muddy Waters.
Big Joe passed away in Macon, Mississippi on December 17th
1982.

				<div class="scrollText"><p>

the guitar.

					<strong>Joseph Lee Williams / “Big Joe”</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Born October 16, 1903 in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi,
Williams was an American Blues guitarist, singer, and
songwriter. He was notable for creating such a distinctive
sound with his unique nine-string guitar. He performed for
almost four decades, before passing in Macon, MS on December
17, 1982.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					I had envisioned using type as a visual element from the very 
					beginning. I wanted to use the symbolism of the nine guitar
strings, since this was an important element in the history of
“Big Joe” Williams. Using tools like liquefy, outer shadows,
and texture, I was able represent what Williams in a more
abstract way. These were skills I had never explored with, so
it was really interesting to explore with.

					<strong>Sister Rosetta Tharpe</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Sister Rosetta Tharpe was born on March 20, 1915, in Cotton
Plant, Arkansas. She became known for her picking technique
and upbeat melodies. Rosetta ultimately created a new genre
known as rock’n’roll paving the way for big names such as Elvis
Presley, Little Richard, and Johnny Cash. She continued to
make music and perform till her death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
on October 9, 1973, and was elected into the Rock &
Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, forty-four years after her death.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					My design philosophy was to accurately represent Sister
Rosetta Tharpe. After researching I discovered how she used
her guitar and her voice to shape future history. Her voice
was powerful and her guitar made sounds that were never heard
of. The way I choose to represent this was to mimic rhymic
soundwaves and abstract the idea of a guitar. Lines across the
page represent the guitar strings vibrating the lyrics from
her most popular songs.

					<strong>Lizzie Douglas aka “Memphis Minnie”</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Lizzie Douglas was born in 1887 and it is unclear whether she
was born in Louisiana or Mississippi. At the very least, she
lived in Walls, Mississippi for the majority of her childhood.
As the years went on, Douglas continued to work her way
up through the blues scene of Beale Street. The record company
she signed to gave her a new stage name, and “Memphis Minnie”
was born. She was known for her sassy and bold style, as
well as her impressive picking technique on the guitar. Some
of her most famous songs include “Bumblebee”, “When the Levee
Breaks”, and “Hoodoo Woman”. Lizzie passed away in 1973 at the
ripe old age of 86.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					For my poster, I wanted to convey her essence through my use
of type. I wanted any illustration to be secondary. She was
very bold and brash, but she also was very feminine. I wanted
her stage name “Memphis Minnie” to be the main focus, as it
is the name that she created for herself. I wanted there to
be a minimal representation of a female figure that is both
sexy and powerful. There is an essay/poem that Langston Hughes
wrote about one of her performances and I really wanted to
include that because I felt like it beautifully conveyed her
essance as a performer. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t relying
on it too much, however, because it would have felt like I was
appropriating his work - so I tried to make the type a bit
illegible, so the sentiment is there without being quite so
literal.

					<strong>Ma Rainey</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Ma Rainey was an influential American blues singer and early
blues recording artist. She was known as the “Mother of
the Blues.” She was born April 26, 1886 in Columbus, Georgia
and sadly died December 22, 1939 in Rome, Georgia. Ma Rainey
was known for her deep throated voice and mesmerizing stage
presence that drew packed audiences and sold out hit records
in the early 20th century. Rainey’s songwriting was notable
for its raw depiction of life from the perspective of a woman
struggling with heartbreak, depression, and other maladies.
But amidst these difficulties, Rainey’s protagonists did not
rely on male partners or submit to the rules society tried to
inflict on them.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					Ma Rainey’s lyrics and her melodies reflected her experiences
as an independant openly bisexual African-American women.
I originally wanted to do an all black and white poster but,
once I found out she was bisexual, I immeidatly thought including
bright, fun, pops of color would be perfect for my
poster. I knew I wanted to focus my poster on Ma Rainey when
she performs and one thing I found out is that she always performed
with a blue feather fan. I really wanted the poster
to circle around that fan beacause it was a staple of hers.
I used photoshop for most of my project to really make those
bright colors work.

					<strong>Medgar Evers</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Medgar Evers was born in Decatur, MS on July 2,
1925. After serving in europe during World War II,
Medgar realized how restrictive Jim crow laws were
in his country and hometown. He attended Alcorn
college and we on to become a civil rights activist.
He focused on crimes against African Americans
and set up boycotts against businesses that practiced
discrimination. He also worked to overturn 
segregation at the University of Mississippi and
expand opportunities for African Americans, which
included the enforcement of voting rights.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					I was immediatly drawn to Medgar’s qoute , “You can kill a man, but you can’t kill an idea.”
I also wanted to include his patience towards violence. I kept my illustration of medgar
happy and soft, even though he had sharp opjects pointing at him, to represent his patience.
I also included the second part of the qoute with all black text to stand out more.
The circle behind Medgar represents his legacy and ideas that can’t be killed. Finally, I
added a texture using type of the word “idea” repeating to further elaborate his ideas
being alive and living on.

					<strong>Margaret Walker</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Margaret Walker (1915-1998) was born in Birmingham, Alabama.
She was a poet, novelist, and she was an educator. During
her time teaching in Jackson State College, Margaret Walker
founded the Institute for the Study of History, Life, and Culture
of Black People (now called the Margaret Walker Alexander
National Research Center). This institute was founded to
preserve and interpret Black history and culture in America.
Margaret Walker influenced many writers around the country and
made a lasting impact and legacy in Jackson State University.
She is still remembered as one of the foremost transcribers of
African American Heritage.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					For this project, I wanted to emphasize Walker’s poem “For My
People.” To me, the poem was very powerful in the word choices
Walker choose and it uplifts the spirit of the Black Americans
who were suppressed during the 1940s. I discovered many
pamphletes of complilation of poetry that she wrote and sold
to the public. For the background of this poster, I handwrote
stanza 1-4, and the last stanza of the poem on loose leaf paper
to represent Walker’s academia career. The poem was handwritten
because I want to preserve Walker’s writing as she
has created a center for preserving African American Heritage
in Jackson State University. To me it symbolizes the preserving
her work while still adding my own personal touch to
the design. The doodles that are on the page were taken from
Walker’s own personal journals from the Margaret Walker Center
digital archives. I highlighted all the “-ing” verbs from
the poem to show how slaves were treated to just work, “never
gaining, never reaping, never knowing, never understanding.”
I crossed them out as a symbol of going on strike, and to represent
the civil rights movement. I wanted to highlight the
last stanza of the poem since it is the call to action. “Rise
and take control” was the last line of the poem, and I superimposed
it on top of the handwritten poem on the background to
depict that there is always a way to arise from all the hardships
and take control of the circumstances. My design process
was mostly doing extensive research and scanning manuscripts
that I created. I think the most important design philosophy
behind my work is that I wanted to represent Margaret Walker
both explicitly and implicitly through every step of my design
process. From the loose leaf paper background to the message,
I wanted this poster to be an extension of Walker’s beliefs
and uplifting words that can create an impact in the viewer’s
life.

					<strong>Jimmy "Duck" Holmes</strong><br><br>
					ABOUT:<br><br>
					Jimmy “Duck” Holmes was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi and is
74 years old. He earned his platform with the Bentonia
Bluesman playing at the oldest surviving juke joint in
Mississippi, Blue Front Cafe.
				</p></div>

				<div class="scrollText"><p>
					CONCEPT:<br><br>
					Jimmy “Duck” Holmes doesn’t know where the nickname “Duck”
came from- which is what inspired this piece. I wanted the focus
to be on a bold rubber duck that prefaces his name without
actually spelling it out. I illustrated the rubber duck in a
way that represents him to help further reach the point.
