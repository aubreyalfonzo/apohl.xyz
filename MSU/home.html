    <h2>TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <hr class="a">
      <p>My pursuit of teaching design exists also as a pursuit of continued learning. Design practice and the study
of design are intertwined deeply into my working philosophy, as the act of practice is also an act of
education.<br><br>
My objectives as an educator are to expand and cultivate both local and global design communities, to
bring more experimentation of tools and media into the classroom, to institute a greater focus on design
theory and research, to engage students in self-expression and self-reflection (as well as humility) in their
work, and to structure each project under the umbrella of goal-oriented design by way of practical and
experimental applications.<br><br>
These objectives continue into my private practice and research. It is important that I as an educator
continue to pursue the very goals I set for my students. I will bring a certain level of transparency into the
classroom, regarding my practice and professional development, to offer insight and engagement into the
building of a career in design post-graduation.<br><br>
Regarding the structure of a project or semester, there shall be a strong focus on concept development and
research, exploration of tools, and preliminary work, before the process of visual outputs begin. The aim
is to build a foundation in a variety of design tools and principles with each project. In the field of visual
communication, designers have the unique responsibility of understanding both their own ideals and
industry, and also that of their clients and collaborators. It is imperative for students to understand that the
design community also belongs to the communities that surround it. I will build versatility both in
practice and principle with a range of multidisciplinary projects, tools and media, and methods of work
presentation. The intent for goal-oriented practices in the classroom is to engage students in design
informed by message. The implementation of research-based thesis projects, in addition to portfolio
development, is a way to address these concepts as well as work ethic, time management, selfexploration,
and critical thinking.<br><br>
The projection of the self is a delicate but important issue that must be addressed with developing
designers. Even the most experimental design practices adhere to some degree of practicality and
accessibility. Design is an act of community, after all. Although it is important for designers to develop
their own brand, methods, styles, and approaches to the practice, the work should speak to its intended
audience and be informed conceptually by the message.<br><br>
Design should be practical, and engage the public, but should also be expressive, exciting, visceral, and
explorative. I will maintain this excitement in student work by engaging students in self-led and
collaborative real-world selected projects such as zines, publications, competitions, and exhibitions where
the classroom shifts from that of academia to working studio culture. This process allows myself as a
design authority to articulate the importance of discipline as well as self-discipline in the design practice.<br><br>
In summary, the act of teaching should not only institute instruction, discipline, and guidance, but also
experimentation, collaboration, and willingness to continue learning both as a figure in academic
authority and as a practicing designer. Fundamentally, my current desire to shift from student to educator
stems not from past teaching experience, but the desire to immerse myself in the field as deeply as
possible. My love for the practice has translated into a love for sharing, continuing, and cultivating
knowledge for my peers, predecessors, and the design community.</p>
